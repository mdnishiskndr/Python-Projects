Projects:

1. Guess The Number

   Overview:

   The "Guess The Number" game starts by prompting the user to input a maximum range for the guessing number. The program handles input validation to ensure the user        provides a positive integer. If the input is valid, the program generates a random number within the specified range. The user then attempts to guess the random          number, with the program providing feedback on whether each guess is too high or too low. The guessing continues until the user correctly guesses the number, at which    point the program announces the correct guess and displays the total number of guesses made.


3. Turtle Race Simulation

   Overview:

   This Python project simulates a turtle race using the 'turtle' graphics library. Users can specify the number of racers, and the program will create turtles that race    across the screen. The race is won by the first turtle to reach the top of the window. The project includes user input handling, random movements, and basic graphical    display using 'turtle'.

   This project is a simple yet engaging demonstration of user interaction, randomization, and graphical representation in Python using the 'turtle' library.
