Projects:

1. Guess The Number

   Overview:


2. Turtle Race Simulation

   Overview:

   This Python project simulates a turtle race using the 'turtle' graphics library. Users can specify the number of racers, and the program will create turtles that race    across the screen. The race is won by the first turtle to reach the top of the window. The project includes user input handling, random movements, and basic graphical    display using 'turtle'.

   This project is a simple yet engaging demonstration of user interaction, randomization, and graphical representation in Python using the 'turtle' library.
